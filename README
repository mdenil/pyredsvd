This is a python library for fast randomized PCA.

The original C++ code comes from here: http://code.google.com/p/redsvd/wiki/English

Some stupidly naive tests reveal that this code is marginally slower than scikit.learn's randomized PCA for dense matrices, and much slower for sparse matrices (presumably because I need to copy sparse matrices to use Eigen).
